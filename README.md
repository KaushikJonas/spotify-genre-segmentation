üéß **Spotify Segmentation**

**Segmentation** in Spotify refers to dividing users (or songs) into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This helps Spotify personalize recommendations, ads, and improve user experience.

### 1. **User Segmentation**

Spotify segments users based on:

* **Demographics**: Age, gender, country.
* **Behavioral Data**: Listening habits, time of day, skip rate, session duration.
* **Preferences**: Favorite genres, liked songs, repeat tracks.

Example segments:

* ‚ÄúMorning chill playlist lovers‚Äù
* ‚ÄúPop music fans who use Spotify while working out‚Äù
* ‚ÄúNew users who skip most tracks‚Äù

### 2. **Music/Track Segmentation**

Songs are segmented based on:

* **Audio features** (from Spotify API):

  * `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, `tempo`, `acousticness`, etc.
* **Genres** and **mood tags**

Clustering algorithms (like **K-means**) can group similar songs together:

* Cluster 1: High energy, fast tempo (Party tracks)
* Cluster 2: Low energy, high acousticness (Calm, study music)

## üí° **Building a Recommendation System (Simple Version)**

A **Recommendation System** suggests songs to users based on past behavior or similarities.

### ‚úÖ **Main Approaches:**

---

### 1. **Content-Based Filtering**

Recommends items similar to what the user already liked.

* Uses song metadata or audio features.
* Example: If you liked a high-energy pop song ‚Üí recommends similar ones based on `danceability`, `genre`, etc.

**Tools:** Cosine Similarity, KNN, TF-IDF (for lyrics or metadata)

---

### 2. **Collaborative Filtering**

Recommends based on user interactions (ratings, plays).

* **User-User**: "People like you also liked..."
* **Item-Item**: "This song is liked by users who also liked your favorite songs."

**Tools:** Matrix Factorization (like SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

---

### 3. **Hybrid System (Used by Spotify)**

Combines content-based + collaborative + context-aware data.

* Also includes temporal data: What time you listen.
* Mood detection, location, device used, etc.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to Build a Basic Music Recommender System**

1. **Collect Data**

   * Spotify API (audio features, user listening history)
   * Public datasets (like [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/))

2. **Preprocess Data**

   * Handle missing values
   * Normalize features (for clustering)

3. **Exploratory Analysis**

   * Cluster songs using K-Means
   * Visualize with PCA or t-SNE

4. **Build the Recommender**

   * Content-based: Use cosine similarity on audio features
   * Collaborative filtering: Use matrix factorization
   * Hybrid: Combine both methods

5. **Evaluate**

   * Precision, Recall, RMSE, user satisfaction (if test users available)

### üß† Tools & Libraries

* Python
* `pandas` (for manipulating Dataframe)
* `spotipy` (Spotify API)
* `numpy` (for collaborative filtering)
* `sklearn` (Machine Learning Tasks)
* `scipy`  (for importing stats module)
